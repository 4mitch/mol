# Quick start

**Create PMS project**

Easy way is checkout [this preconfigured PMS repository](http://github.com/nin-jin/pms/) and start dev server:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nin-jin/pms.git ./pms && cd pms
npm start
```

**Create your application component**

In examples we will use namespace `my` and application name `hello`, but you must use your own namespace and application name.

Add **web entry point** at `./my/hello/index.html`:`

```html
<!doctype html>
<head>
	<!-- page title -->
	<title>Hello World!</title>
	
	<!-- Force utf-8 dencoding -->
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	
	<!-- Disable modile browser auto zoom, $mol is adaptive -->
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
	
	<!-- link to autogenerated css bundle -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="-/web.css" />
</head>
<body>
	<!-- autobind component to element on load -->
	<div mol_viewer_root="$my_hello"></div>
	
	<!-- links to autogenerated realease and test js bundles -->
	<script src="-/web.js"></script>
	<script src="-/web.test.js"></script>
</body>
```

Your application will be served at **`http://localhost:8080/my/hello/`**.

Add **declarative component description** at `./my/hello/hello.view.tree` with string input field and greeting message:
```tree
$my_hello $mol_viewer childs /
	< input $mol_stringer
		hint \Name
		value > name \
	< message \
```

That will be compiled to typescript code like this:

```typescript
module $ { export class $my_hello extends $mol_viewer {

	/// name \
	@ $mol_prop()
	name( ...diff : any[] ) {
		return ( diff[0] !== void 0 ) ? diff[0] : ""
	}

	/// input $mol_stringer 
	/// 	hint \Name
	/// 	value > name
	@ $mol_prop()
	input( ...diff : any[] ) {
		return ( diff[0] !== void 0 ) ? diff[0] : new $mol_stringer().setup( __ => { 
			__.hint = () => "Name"
			__.value = ( ...diff : any[] ) => this.name(  ...diff )
		} )
	}

	/// message \
	message() {
		return ""
	}

	/// childs / 
	/// 	< input 
	/// 	< message
	childs() {
		return [].concat( this.input() , this.message() )
	}

} }
```

Add **your behaviour** at `./my/hello/hello.view.ts` by extending generated class:

```typescript
module $.$mol {
	export class $my_hello extends $.$my_hello {
		
		message() {
			let name = this.name()
			return name && `Hello, ${name}!`
		}
		
	}
}
```

Add **styles** at `./my/hello/hello.view.css`:

```css
/* Styling BEM-block by autogenerated attribute */
[my_hello] {
	margin: auto;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
	font: 1.5rem/1 sans-serif;
}

/* Styling BEM-element by autogenerated attribute */
[my_hello_input] {
	flex-grow: 0;
	margin: 1rem;
}
```

[That is all!](https://eigenmethod.github.io/mol/app/hello/)

# Rationale

## Zero configuration
Instead of creating configuration files for an application you want, we better concentrate on working the application 
at one from the box and don't bothers mol's developer creating configuration. 
But of course you could setup for you needs if you want.

For example if you download **[базовый PMS-проект](http://github.com/nin-jin/pms/)** you'd have got that:

**An assembly of JS and CSS bundles for any platforms.** A bundle can be assembled for any module and there are sources 
of that module and sources all other modules from witch this module depends and no redundant modules would be there.  

There are full set of supports bundles:

* `-/web.js` - JS for browser
* `-/web.test.js` - JS with tests for a browser
* `-/web.css` - CSS styles for a browser
* `-/web.deps.json` - a map of dependencies modules for browser
* `-/node.js` - JS for NodeJS
* `-/node.test.js` - JS with tests for NodeJS
* `-/node.deps.json` - a map of dependencies modules for NodeJS

**Support of Source Maps**. Sources are compiled and integrate to maps, they are fully self-sufficient.

**development server**, witch would be compile bundles as needed. For example, 
when requested `http://localhost:8080/mol/app/todomvc/-/web.js` a build is being assembled `js` of `mol/app/todomvc` project 
and `web` environment. Rebuilding would be occur only if some source file would be changed.

**Translating of modern CSS into CSS supported by browsers** 
([postcss-cssnext](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext)): arrange prefixes and variables etc.

**Translating [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) into JS**. 
In TS configuration enabled support annotation and automatic arrangement any types, 
for prevent a missing typing by change.

**Watching dependencies by fact of using** and inclusion needed modules automatically at further bundle.
You don't need to write `include` and `require` everything you need is to refer for essence by full name 
like `$mol_state_arg` and `$mol.state.arg` (looking at its definition) in `*.ts`, `*.view.ts` и `*.view.tree` files. 
At CSS files its dependencies are looked for by entries 
like `[mol_checker_checked]` , `[mol_checker_checked=` and `.mol_checker_checked`.

## Lego components

A component approach is used by $mol to building an interface, but **every component is self-sufficient** and can be used 
as a self-sufficient application. Small component are collected inside of larger components etc.

Unlike of another frameworks the $mol does not seek to isolate insides of components. Vice versa, there are comfortable 
mechanism for configuration them is provided for developers, and there are not any gestures is required from creator 
of the component.

For example, to set a list of childs components you need to redefine `childs` property in view.tree
 
 ```tree
$mol_viewer childs /
	< button1
	< button2
 ```

Or the same through TypeScript:
 
 ```typescript
 new $mol_viewer().setup( obj => {
 	obj.childs = ()=> [ this.button1() , this.button2() ]
 } )
 ```
In both variants a compiler verify existing of property and signature of it.
In normal mode working with properties of object is not required, therefore all defining properties 
are public and can be safely overloaded.

## Lazyness
[$mol_viewer](viewer) realizes the conception of lazy rendering. [$mol_scroller](scroller) is watching scroll's position and suggest to the embedded components about the viewport size. [$mol_lister](lister) knowing about the viewport size and minimal sizes of the embedded components, it excludes from rendering process the components that is not got into viewport for sure. And all other components can suggest it about their minimal size through `heightMinimal` property.

```
$my_icon $mol_viewer
	heightMinimal 16
```
At the result it come out than opening any window occur while instant time. It's independent of output data size.
And since data would not be rendered, then any requests would not be proceeded. It's allowed us to download them partly, when they are needed. That features are possible due to reactive architecture, that are penetrated all layers of application.

## Reactivity
Unlike the control-flow architectures, in $mol was realized the data-flow architecture. All applications are described as a set of classes, having properties. Every property is described as some function from another property ( and properties another classes too). Properties, to which were appealed while function processing were saved as dependencies of our property. In case of changing their values, all dependant on them properties would be invalidated cascaded. And appealing to non relevant property would lead to its pre-actualization.

In this way the whole application at the execution stage represents a huge tree of dependencies, at the root of the tree is located the special property, which in case of invalidation would actualize itself automatically. And as any property always knows, whether something depends from it or not, then it is given a simple and reliable mechanism of controlling lifecycle of objects - they creates if the dependence appears and are destroyed when nothing depend from it. It's solved two fundamental problem: resources leaks and cache invalidation. 

Besides, the reactive architecture allows us to abstract code elegantly from asynchronous operations. If the function can't return value at once, it can throws the exception `$mol_atom_wait`, it is marked part of the tree of states as "waiting of results". When the result would be retrieved - it could be inserted into property directly and an application would be reconstructed under the new state.

```typescript
class Greeter {
	
	// Define memoized property with push support
	@ $mol_prop()
	greeting( ...diff : string[] ) : string {
		
		// Defered push value to property
		setTimeout( () => {
			this.greeting( void 0 , 'Hello!' )
		} , 1000 )
		
		// throw special error to notify about waiting
		throw new $mol_atom_wait( 'Wait!' )
	}
	
	// Define memoized property without push support
	@ $mol_prop()
	greetingLength() {
		// Using other properties in synchronous style
		return this.greeting().length
	}
	
}
```

Details: [$mol_prop](prop), [$mol_atom](atom).

## Debugging
A special attention is payed while developing $mol to debugging possibilities and researching of code's working process. For example for handling exceptions nowhere is used intercepting them with forwarding (`try-catch-throw`),
 because it masks the true place where exceptions were arisen, it complicates debugging. 

For every DOM-element is formed a people friendly `id` automatically like `$mol_app_todomvc.root(0).taskRow(0).titler()`,
which is valid javascript code, this one could be executed at a console, received a link to the component, whom the component is corresponds to. Unfolding the content of the component you'd see names and values its fields like:

```
$mol_app_todomvc
    DOMNode() : div#$mol_app_todomvc.root(0)
    task(1474385802391) : Object
    task(1474386443175) : Object
    taskRow(0) : $mol_app_todomvc_taskRow
    taskRow(1) : $mol_app_todomvc_taskRow
    taskRows() : Array[2]
```
The name of the field corresponds to calling the property, the content of the field would be available through. And thanks to naming classes and functions through underscoring you'd always get to know witch class instance in front of you and could briefly find it at code by default searching by the substring.
